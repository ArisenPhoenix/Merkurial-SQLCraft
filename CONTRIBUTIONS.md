# Contributing to Merkurial SQLCraft

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute to **Merkurial SQLCraft**! 🚀

## 📌 Ground Rules

- I welcome contributions that improve the codebase, fix bugs, or expand functionality.
- All changes must be submitted through a pull request (PR) — direct commits to `main` are not allowed.
- Every PR will be reviewed by the project owner before merging.
- Please keep code modular and consistent with the current structure and design philosophy.

## 🧱 Project Style

- This project is written in **TypeScript** and aims to maintain a clean, modular architecture.
- Avoid patchwork — if you're adding a feature, think through how it integrates with the system.
- Abstractions (like `QUERY_GENERATOR` and `SQL_HELPERS`) are preferred over one-off helpers.

## 📤 Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork** the repo.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
3. Make your changes and test them.
4. Open a **pull request** against the `main` branch.
5. Clearly describe what the PR does and why it's useful.

## 💬 Communication

If you're unsure about an approach, feel free to open a [discussion](https://github.com/ArisenPhoenix/Merkurial-SQLCraft/discussions) or issue first.

## 🧪 Testing (Optional but Encouraged)

Unit or integration tests are encouraged for complex logic, especially in query generation or data mutation logic.
